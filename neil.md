Good morning @co-hort-NeilM,

TA_Kyle and I will be here this week while Neil is out. Don't worry we have setup, not one but two live Belt reviews for you to assist with exam prep.

First choice:
@Instructor_SaurabhD: 2-Day Belt Review, 4 parts; Tuesday & Wednesday @ 9am PST / 10am MST and 1pm PST / 2pm Mountain - Zoom link: https://codingdojo.zoom.us/j/84309980313

Second choice:
@Instructor_NicholeK: 1-Day Belt Review on Wednesday 7/20 @ 8am PST / 10am CST, goes all the way until lunch time, small break, then starts up again - Zoom link: https://codingdojo.zoom.us/j/98075771979?pwd=S0paOUNoWWFyMyt1VVIrQTBwcXR6QT09

If you prefer to work on assignments feel free to hang back in @Instructor_Neil's zoom room. I can get the belt review recorded video links from @Instructor_SaurabhD and @Instructor_NicholeK.
